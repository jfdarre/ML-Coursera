Oh, we much preferred receiving advice! We spend much of our time on business matters, so hearing about life in Manila and how to best prepare for it, is a welcome change. Please don't apologize at all.

Thank you again, and we look forward to seeing you both next year!

Vince, we will likely get some OL folks together in the next few weeks, and you are most welcome to join us. But better save your last Ace Card for another time.

Best,
Carissa
